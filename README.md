# Isolating Race Vectors in Latent Space

## Overview
This project explores methods to identify and isolate race-related vectors in the latent space of generative models and embeddings. The purpose is to better understand how sensitive attributes are encoded and how to analyze/manipulate them.

## Installation
Clone the repo and install dependencies via these commands -
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arnavsharma2/Isolating-Race-Vectors-in-Latent-Space.git
cd Isolating-Race-Vectors-in-Latent-Space
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
You can run the project on Google Colab or locally:
- For Colab, you must use a runtime with a maximum of python 3.11 to support mediapipe.
- For local execution, ensure Python 3.11 is installed and open the notebooks in the notebooks folder or the run_race_vectors.py script.

## Ethical Considerations
This project deals with sensitive attributes such as race. It is intended for academic and research purposes aimed at promoting fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI systems. Misuse of this work for discriminatory, harmful, or deceptive applications is prohibited.

Please ensure you:
- Obtain appropriate consent and follow privacy regulations when using data
- Avoid profiling or targeting individuals based on protected characteristics
